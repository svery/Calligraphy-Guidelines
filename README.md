# Calligraphy-Guidelines

Guideline generator for calligraphy.

- nib width and proportions
- adjustable slant and slant frequency
- adjustable line weight and style


Todo (stuff people may want but I don't particularly care for):

- nib ladders
- short ascenders / descenders
- proper form (Google doc?)
